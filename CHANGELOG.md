## 🔖 [1.3.0] — 2026-03-22

### 📦 Modular Architecture + Loading Animation + .htaccess Guide

---

#### Modular Architecture — index.html split into three files

- **The problem:** `index.html` had grown to 130KB+ with 1,161 lines of CSS and 1,434 lines of JavaScript all inline. Difficult to read, maintain, or version-diff. Browsers also can't independently cache inline assets.
- **The fix:** CSS and JS extracted into dedicated modules:
  - `app.css` — all styles (41KB, 1,170 lines)
  - `app.js` — all JavaScript (73KB, 1,440 lines)
  - `index.html` — clean HTML shell only (29KB, ~530 lines)
- `index.html` links the modules via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css">` and `<script src="app.js"></script>`.
- Browsers now cache `app.css` and `app.js` independently — subsequent page loads only re-fetch `index.html` if the CSS/JS haven't changed.
- **index.html reduced by 77.8%** — from 130KB to 29KB.

#### Row Loading Animation — 500ms minimum

- **The problem:** DNS queries for fast-resolving domains (< 100ms) caused rows to flash so briefly the user couldn't tell a scan was happening. The progressive scan effect was invisible.
- **The fix:** `setRowLoading()` now enforces a **500ms minimum dim duration**:
  - On `setRowLoading(domain, true)`: row gets class `is-checking` (opacity 0.32) and start timestamp is recorded in `_rowLoadingStart[domain]`.
  - On `setRowLoading(domain, false)`: elapsed time is calculated. If less than `MIN_ROW_LOADING_MS` (500ms), the un-dim is deferred by the remainder via `setTimeout`.
  - On un-dim: `is-checking` swaps to `is-checking-done`, which triggers a slow 600ms CSS fade-in so each row "lights up" satisfyingly as it completes.
- **Scan progress bar:** A horizontal animated sweep bar appears below the status bar during any full `checkAll()` run and hides with a fade on completion.
- **Per-row ↺ button** now uses a CSS class (`is-spinning`) for the rotation animation instead of inline `style.animation`, making it easier to override via CSS.

#### .htaccess Documentation (INSTALL.md Option B)

- **The problem:** Option B (cron-job.org) requires an `.htaccess` rewrite rule for `webhook.do` to be accessible. This was not documented — users setting up cron-job.org would see 404 errors without knowing why.
- **The fix:** A new `⚠️ Required: .htaccess rule for webhook.do` section added at the top of Option B, before the cron-job.org setup steps. Explains:
  - Why the rule is mandatory (server needs to map `.do` to the HTML file)
  - The exact `RewriteRule` for Apache/SiteGround
  - Step-by-step instructions for adding it in SiteGround File Manager
  - A troubleshooting table mapping HTTP status codes (200/404/403/500) to causes
- Option B now also includes instructions to **test the webhook URL manually** in a browser before setting up the cron job.

### ✨ Added

- **`app.css`** — extracted CSS module (41KB)
- **`app.js`** — extracted JS module (73KB)
- **`MIN_ROW_LOADING_MS = 500`** constant — minimum row dim duration
- **`_rowLoadingStart` dict** — tracks start timestamps per domain for minimum enforcement
- **`is-checking` CSS class** — applies `opacity: 0.32` with 150ms transition in
- **`is-checking-done` CSS class** — applies 600ms opacity fade to 1 on un-dim
- **`scan-progress-wrap` / `scan-progress-bar`** — animated sweep bar shown during `checkAll()`
- **`@keyframes scan-sweep`** — horizontal sweep animation for the progress bar
- **`is-spinning` CSS class** — spin animation for per-row ↺ button
- **INSTALL.md Option B** — `⚠️ Required: .htaccess rule` section with SiteGround instructions

### 🔄 Changed

- `index.html` — inline `<style>` and `<script>` replaced with `<link>` and `<script src>`
- `setRowLoading(domain, loading)` — complete rewrite with 500ms minimum and CSS class approach
- `refreshRow()` — uses `classList.add/remove('is-spinning')` instead of `style.animation`
- `checkAll()` — shows/hides `scan-progress-wrap` at start/end of scan
- INSTALL.md Option B — mandatory `.htaccess` step now appears before cron-job.org setup

## 🔖 [1.2.0] — 2026-03-22

### 🔐 Live SSL Expiry + NS Accuracy + DNS Parsing Fixes

---

#### Live SSL Expiry via crt.sh

- **The problem:** SSL expiry dates were static — seeded from a one-time scan on 2026-03-21. They displayed correctly (days are computed live from today via `daysUntil()`), but for custom domains added at runtime, `sslExpiry` was always `null` → shown as `—` in the table.
- **The fix:** A new `fetchSSLExpiry(domain)` function queries the [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) certificate transparency log API. It fetches all valid (non-expired) certs for the domain, picks the one expiring latest, extracts the `notAfter` date and detects whether it's a Let's Encrypt cert (CN matches `R3`, `R10`, `E5`, `E7`, etc.).
- **Non-blocking by design:** The call is fired as a background `Promise` inside `checkDomain()` — it does not delay the DNS check or the table render. When the result arrives, it updates the domain entry and calls `renderTable()` so the SSL cell updates live.
- **Only for custom domains:** Built-in top-30 entries have accurate seeded expiry dates from a real scan. The enrichment only fires for domains where `sslExpiry === null` (i.e. newly added custom domains).
- **LE badge:** When the SSL issuer is Let's Encrypt, a green `LE` badge appears next to the days count in the SSL column.

#### NS Provider Accuracy

- **The problem:** Seven well-known domains (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Apple, Yahoo, Pinterest, Cloudflare) self-host their nameservers but were labelled `Own` in the BUILTIN seed data, not `Domain`.
- **The fix:** All seven BUILTIN entries corrected to `ns: 'Domain'`.
- **Verification:** `facebook.com` uses `a/b/c/d.ns.facebook.com`, `apple.com` uses `a/b/c.ns.apple.com`, `cloudflare.com` uses `ns3/4/5.cloudflare.com` — all correctly detected by the v1.1.0 apex-comparison algorithm; seed data now matches.

#### PHP SSL Check (update-stats.php)

- **Added `get_ssl_expiry(string $domain)`** — makes a real TLS handshake to port 443 via `stream_socket_client()`, reads the peer certificate with `openssl_x509_parse()`, and extracts `validTo_time_t`. No curl required.
- SSL expiry and issuer (`LE` / provider name) now included in the `domains.stats` CSV and `domains.json` output.
- Log lines now show: `→ UP | 28ms | SSL=2026-06-06 (LE) | NS=SiteGround | MX=ProtonMail | DMARC=quarantine`

### ✨ Added

- **`fetchSSLExpiry(domain)`** — async, queries crt.sh CT log API, returns `{expiry: 'YYYY-MM-DD', issuer: string}` or `null` on failure
- **LE badge** in SSL column — green `LE` tag shown when issuer is Let's Encrypt
- **`get_ssl_expiry()`** PHP function in `update-stats.php` — real TLS cert check via `stream_socket_client()`
- **`ssl_expiry` and `ssl_issuer`** columns added to CSV output and `$results[]` array in PHP

### 🔄 Changed

- **7 BUILTIN NS entries** corrected from `'Own'` to `'Domain'`: `facebook.com`, `instagram.com`, `whatsapp.com`, `apple.com`, `yahoo.com`, `pinterest.com`, `cloudflare.com`
- `checkDomain()` — background SSL enrichment fires for domains with `sslExpiry === null`
- `renderTable()` — `leBadge` variable added; SSL cell now renders `<span class="le-badge">LE</span>` when applicable

## 🔖 [1.1.0] — 2026-03-22

### 🔐 First-PIN-Sets-PIN + Smart NS Detection + DNS Parsing Hardening

---

#### First-PIN-Sets-PIN

- **The problem:** The default PIN (`123456`) is public knowledge — anyone who finds the dashboard URL can enter it. There was no friction to nudge users toward changing it.
- **The fix:** After a successful unlock with the *default* PIN, a second modal appears before the dashboard loads, asking the user to set a personal 6-digit PIN. The new PIN is entered once and confirmed — if they match, the PIN_HASH in memory updates immediately. The script then attempts an HTTP PUT to rewrite `index.html` on the server so the change persists across reloads. On static hosts where PUT is blocked, a dialog shows the new hash for manual copy/paste into the file.
- **Skip option:** Users who want to keep `123456` (e.g. public demos) can click "Skip for now" and proceed immediately.
- **The PIN hint** in the login overlay no longer shows `123456` — it just says "Enter PIN", so the default isn't advertised to visitors.

#### Smart NS Provider Detection

- **The problem:** All self-hosted nameservers were labelled `Own` — a vague catch-all. In practice there are meaningful distinctions:
  - `ns1.siteground.net` → SiteGround (very common, very specific)
  - `ns3.cloudflare.com` for `cloudflare.com` → the domain hosts its own NS (self-referential)
  - `a.ns.apple.com` for `apple.com` → same self-referential pattern
  - `ns1.amazon.com` for a third-party domain → `Own` (correct)
- **The fix:** A two-step detection algorithm replaces the flat `Own` fallback:
  1. **Named providers first** — AWS, Azure, Google, NS1, Akamai, Wikimedia, ClouDNS, DNSimple, and now **SiteGround** all have explicit pattern matches.
  2. **Apex domain comparison** — extract the last two DNS labels from each NS hostname and compare to the monitored domain's own apex. If all NS hostnames share their apex with the domain (e.g. `cloudflare.com` → `ns3.cloudflare.com`), label it **`Domain`** — meaning the domain operates its own nameserver infrastructure.
  3. **NS-in-domain check** — if an NS hostname contains the monitored domain's apex as a substring, extract and capitalise the domain name as the label (e.g. `ns1.paulfleury.com` would label as `Paulfleury`).
  4. **`Own` fallback** — only for genuinely unknown third-party registrar NS that don't match any of the above.
- **`detectNSProvider(nsRecords, domain)`** — the function now takes a second `domain` argument for the self-NS comparison. All call sites updated.
- **Two new helper functions added:**
  - `apexDomain(hostname)` — extracts the last two DNS labels (e.g. `sub.example.com` → `example.com`)
  - `capitalise(s)` — capitalises the first letter of a string

#### DNS Parsing Hardening

- **The problem:** Cloudflare DoH wraps all TXT record values in double-quotes: `"v=spf1 …"` and `"v=DMARC1; p=quarantine"`. While `.includes()` searches happened to work through the quotes in most cases, the regex match for SPF qualifier (`~all`, `-all`) could fail if the regex anchored at a quote character.
- **The fix:** All three parsing functions now strip leading and trailing double-quotes before analysis:
  - `parseSPF(txtRecords)` — strips `"` wrappers, then matches `v=spf1` and `[~\-+?]all`
  - `parseDMARCPolicy(txtRecords)` — strips `"` wrappers, then matches `v=dmarc1` and `p=reject/quarantine/none`
  - `detectMXProvider(mxRecords)` — strips the priority prefix (`"10 "`, `"20 "`) and trailing dot from MX data before provider matching
- **Additional MX providers added:** Fastmail, Apple iCloud (`icloud.com`, `apple.com`)
- **Null/empty guards added** to `detectNSProvider`, `detectMXProvider` — return `—` or `None` gracefully instead of throwing on empty arrays

### ✨ Added

- **`checkFirstUse()`** — called by `pinCheck()` after correct PIN; routes to Set-PIN modal if default PIN, otherwise straight to `initDashboard()`
- **`spDigit(d)`** — digit handler for the Set-PIN numpad (phase 1: new PIN, phase 2: confirm)
- **`spDelete()`** — backspace handler for Set-PIN numpad
- **`spConfirm()`** — validates PIN match, updates `PIN_HASH` in memory, calls `spPersistHash()`
- **`spSkip()`** — skips Set-PIN flow, calls `initDashboard()` directly
- **`spUpdateDots(errorRow?)`** — updates both rows of PIN dots; dims confirm row until new PIN is complete
- **`spPersistHash(newHash)`** — async; fetches `index.html`, replaces `PIN_HASH` line via regex, PUTs the file back; returns `true` on success
- **Set-PIN modal HTML** — two dot rows (new + confirm), full numpad, error message, skip link
- **`apexDomain(hostname)`** — DNS apex extraction helper
- **`capitalise(s)`** — string helper
- **`DEFAULT_PIN_HASH`** constant — SHA-256 of `123456`, used to detect first-use condition
- **SiteGround** explicit NS detection pattern
- **Fastmail**, **Apple iCloud** MX provider patterns
- **`detectNSProvider` second argument** `domain` — required for self-NS comparison

### 🔄 Changed

- `detectNSProvider(nsRecords)` → `detectNSProvider(nsRecords, domain)` — **breaking if called without domain arg**, but only called from `checkDomain()` which was updated
- `parseSPF()` — now strips `"` wrappers from TXT data before matching
- `parseDMARCPolicy()` — now strips `"` wrappers from TXT data before matching
- `detectMXProvider()` — strips `"priority "` prefix from MX data before matching
- PIN hint text changed from `"Demo PIN: 1 2 3 4 5 6 · keyboard works too"` to `"Enter PIN · keyboard works too"` — no longer advertises the default PIN to visitors
- `pinCheck()` now calls `checkFirstUse()` instead of `initDashboard()` directly
